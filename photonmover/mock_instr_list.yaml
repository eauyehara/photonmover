# Describes the instruments present in the setup.
# This should be constructed as a list, where each element of the list is
# a dictionary describing a specific instrument
# Each dictionary should at least have two keys:
  # - "class_name", that indicates the class to be instantiated;
  # - "class_package", which indicates the package to contains the class definition
# Optionally, if the constructor requires parameters an additional key "class_params" (which is another
# dictionary where each key is a parameter for the constructor).

Instruments:
  - # laser
    class_name: 'MockLaser'
    class_package: 'instruments.Lasers.MockLaser'

  - # Source meter
    class_name: 'MockSourceMeter'
    class_package: 'instruments.Source_meters.MockSourceMeter'

  - # Power meter
    class_name: 'MockPowerMeter'
    class_package: 'instruments.Power_meters.MockPowerMeter'

  - # VNA
    class_name: 'MockVNA'
    class_package: 'instruments.Vector_network_analyzers.MockVNA'
